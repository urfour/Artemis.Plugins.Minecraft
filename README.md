[![GitHub release version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/urfour/ArtemisMC-Plugin.svg)](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases)

Artemis plugin for Minecraft Game State Integration.

## Installation

If your Minecraft directory is located in the standard folder, Artemis will automatically install all the required files.
If not, you will need to manually install Fabric and the mod for the plugin to work properly.

There is also a [Forge version](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC-Forge) if needed, but Artemis won't automatically download it.

#### Standard installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC-Plugin/releases/latest) of the plugin as a .zip file
- In Artemis, go to Settings -> Plugins, click "Import plugin", and select the downloaded archive
- The plugin will automatically install Fabric and the [ArtemisMC mod](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases) on Minecraft
- Done!

#### Manual installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC-Plugin/releases/latest) of the mod as a .zip file
- In Artemis, go to Settings -> Plugins, click "Import plugin", and select the downloaded archive
- Download and install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC-Fabric/releases/latest) the mod, and move it to your mods folder
- Done!
